## Key Components

-   **Identity Provider**: Open-source OpenID Connect Identity Provider
-   **Implementation**: Hosted at oidc.login.xyz
-   **Language**: Rust-based implementation

## Workflow

The integration follows a comprehensive authentication workflow that demonstrates the complete authentication process from wallet connection to application access.

### Authentication Flow

1. User clicks login button
2. Redirected to Auth0 SIWE interface
3. Wallet authentication process
4. Redirected back to application
5. Optional ENS name resolution

## Example Application

A demo application showcases the authentication flow:

-   Features a mock NFT gallery website
-   Enables Sign In with Ethereum
-   Resolves NFT holdings via OpenSea API after authentication
-   Available at: [auth0-demo.login.xyz](https://auth0-demo.login.xyz/#/)
