# Sign in with Ethereum

**Sign in with Ethereum** (SIWE) is an authentication method for Ethereum accounts. It can be used by any kind of app, whether crypto-related or not.

## Key Benefits

### ü§ù **Complements other elements of the Ethereum Identity Stack**

After the user authenticates, apps may use their onchain **[ENS](https://ens.domains)** username and profile and **[EFP](https://efp.app)** social graph.

### [‚õìÔ∏è **Enrich your app's UX with onchain data**](./quickstart/retrieve-onchain-data.mdx)

Seamlessly connects user identity with onchain activities, enabling applications to verify user ownership of NFTs, tokens, and other blockchain assets.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Self-Sovereign Identity**

Users maintain control over their identity credentials, eliminating dependency on centralized identity providers like Google or Facebook.

### üñäÔ∏è **Single Sign-On**

Works across any application that implements the SIWE standard, creating a unified authentication and account experience.


## How It Works

SIWE follows a simple authentication flow:

1. **Message Creation**: Application generates a human-readable sign-in message containing domain, address, and security parameters, following the [EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) standard.
2. **User Signing**: User signs the message with the Ethereum wallet of their choice.
3. **Signature Verification**: Application verifies the signature cryptographically to authenticate the user.
4. **Session Establishment**: Upon successful verification, a secure session is created for the authenticated user.

## Open EIP standard

SIWE is defined by **[EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361)** standard.

## Security First

SIWE prioritizes security through:

-   **Nonce-based replay protection** to prevent message reuse attacks
-   **Domain binding** to prevent cross-site message abuse
-   **Expiration timestamps** for time-limited authentication
-   **Best practices guidance** for secure implementation
