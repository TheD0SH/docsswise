# üîë Sign in with Ethereum

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **Sign in with Ethereum** (SIWE), a revolutionary authentication method that enables users to sign in to Web3 applications using their Ethereum accounts instead of traditional centralized identity providers.

## What is Sign in with Ethereum?

Sign in with Ethereum is a standardized authentication protocol that allows users to:

-   **Self-custody their identity** using Ethereum accounts
-   **Prove ownership** of blockchain identities through cryptographic signatures
-   **Authenticate securely** without relying on centralized providers
-   **Maintain privacy** while accessing decentralized applications

SIWE is built on the foundation of **[EIP-4361](general-information/eip-4361-specification.md)**, which standardizes how Ethereum accounts can be used as first-class identities for authentication and authorization in Web3 applications.

## Key Benefits

### üîí **Self-Sovereign Identity**

Users maintain complete control over their identity using Ethereum accounts, eliminating dependency on centralized identity providers like Google, Facebook, or Twitter.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Cryptographic Security**

Authentication relies on cryptographic signatures that prove ownership of Ethereum addresses, providing stronger security guarantees than traditional password-based systems.

### üåê **Universal Compatibility**

Works across any application that implements the SIWE standard, creating a unified authentication experience across the Web3 ecosystem.

### üîó **Blockchain Integration**

Seamlessly connects user identity with on-chain activities, enabling applications to verify user ownership of NFTs, tokens, and other blockchain assets.

## How It Works

SIWE follows a simple authentication flow:

1. **Message Creation**: Application generates a human-readable sign-in message containing domain, address, and security parameters
2. **User Signing**: User signs the message with their Ethereum wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. **Signature Verification**: Application verifies the signature cryptographically to authenticate the user
4. **Session Establishment**: Upon successful verification, a secure session is created for the authenticated user

## Technical Foundation

SIWE is built on established Ethereum standards:

-   **[EIP-4361](general-information/eip-4361-specification.md)**: Core specification for Sign in with Ethereum messages
-   **EIP-191**: Signed Data Standard for message formatting
-   **EIP-712**: Ethereum typed structured data hashing and signing
-   **EIP-1271**: Standard Signature Validation Method for Contracts
