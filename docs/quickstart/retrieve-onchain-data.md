# Retrieve Onchain Data

Once the user has authenticated with their Ethereum account, you may want to consider making use of their onchain data to enrich their experience of your app.

## Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

ENS enables onchain usernames and profiles.

## Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP)

EFP enables an onchain social graph for Ethereum accounts.

## Other Onchain Assets

You may also want to retrieve the user's NFTs, token balances, and other onchain assets.
